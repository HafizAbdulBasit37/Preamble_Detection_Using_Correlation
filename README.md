# QPSK Preamble Detection Using Correlation and RTL Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a **QPSK preamble detection** algorithm using correlation in MATLAB and successfully maps it to **RTL using Verilog** on Vivado. It simulates the generation of a preamble and payload bit sequences, combines them into a QPSK-modulated signal, detects the preamble via cross-correlation, and then demonstrates a hardware implementation.  

The approach is fundamental for synchronization, packet detection, and FPGA-based digital communication systems.

## MATLAB Simulation Usage

1. Open `preamble_detection.m` in MATLAB.  
2. Run the script.  
3. Observe generated plots:  
   - Correlation magnitude vs. sample index  
   - I/Q waveforms for preamble and payload  
   - QPSK constellation diagram  
   - Magnitude and phase of the combined signal

## RTL Implementation on Vivado

- The preamble detection algorithm is implemented in **Verilog**.  
- Vivado was used to synthesize the design, generate RTL diagrams, and simulate waveform results.  
- The design is fully mapped to hardware, demonstrating the feasibility of FPGA-based preamble detection.

## How It Works

1. Define amplitude scaling and samples per bit (oversampling).  
2. Create known preamble bit sequences for I and Q channels, then upsample.  
3. Generate QPSK symbols using Â±A levels for I and Q channels.  
4. Generate payload sequences, modulate, and upsample.  
5. Concatenate preamble and payload signals.  
6. Combine I and Q to form a complex baseband signal.  
7. Perform convolution-based correlation to detect preamble.  
8. Map the algorithm to **Verilog RTL**, simulate, and visualize waveforms.
